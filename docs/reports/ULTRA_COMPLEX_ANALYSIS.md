  ↓
  National + regional comparison (Vietnam vs ASEAN)
  ↓
  Multi-national comparison (6-8 countries per sector)
  ↓
  Continental analysis (EU vs non-EU power sector)
  ↓
  Global assessment (all nations simultaneously)
LEAST DIFFICULT → Pure global metrics

Why: Single city precision requires facility-level mapping
     Regional context requires cross-border analysis
     Global comparison requires normalization
```

  2 sectors with explicit nexus (W2E, supply chain)
  ↓
  Single sector but 6+ countries (comparative analysis)
  ↓
  Single sector but 24-year trend (temporal complexity)
  ↓
  Single sector, single country, single year (baseline assessment)
LEAST DIFFICULT → Single sector data retrieval

Why: 8-sector integration requires understanding interdependencies
     Sector nexus requires causal modeling
     Single sector allows deep expertise
     Temporal/geographic scale additive complexity
```

---

### 3. TEMPORAL COMPLEXITY

  ↓
  24-year span with inflection point identification
  ↓
  24-year span with simple trend
  ↓
  Decade-by-decade analysis with policy linkage
  ↓
  5-year period with target-setting
  ↓
  Single year baseline with inter-country comparison
LEAST DIFFICULT → Single year, single location retrieval

Why: 50-year projection requires uncertainty propagation
     Inflection points require causal analysis
     Policy linkage requires domain expertise
     Simple trends are straightforward extrapolation
```

  ↓
  Hotspot detection + attribution
  ↓
  Comparative analysis across 20 nations

LEAST DIFFICULT → Direct database query

Why: Boundary modeling requires external data (biodiversity, water, etc.)
     Multiple pathways require IAM knowledge
     Causal inference needs econometric understanding
     Hotspot detection requires satellite knowledge
     Comparisons need normalization (per-capita, intensity, etc.)
```

### 5. DATA QUALITY AWARENESS

**Dimension Scale:** Ignore Quality → Accept Quality Limitations → Require Quality Threshold → Use Uncertainty in Analysis

#### By Quality Integration Level:

**Ignore Quality (2 questions):**
- Simple factual queries not considering quality

- Q2, Q3, Q6, Q7, Q8
- Acknowledge synthetic data + uncertainty range

**Require Quality Threshold (15 questions):**
- Q1, Q4, Q5, Q9, Q13, Q14, Q20-Q25
- Only accept quality ≥85/100 or specific synthetic % limits

**Use Uncertainty in Analysis (8 questions):**

- Propagate uncertainty through calculations

**Quality Complexity Ranking:**

```
MOST DIFFICULT → Uncertainty propagation (multi-layer calculations)
  ↓
  Quality-based scenario filtering (only high-quality pathways)
  ↓
  Quality thresholds with synthetic flags
  ↓
  Acknowledge limitations but proceed
  ↓
  Ignore quality considerations
LEAST DIFFICULT → No quality awareness needed

Why: Uncertainty propagation requires statistical expertise
     Filtering for suitability (publication, finance) needs decision rules
     Thresholding is straightforward logic
     Acknowledgment is contextual knowledge
```
