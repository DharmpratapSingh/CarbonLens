## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Enhanced Dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/dharmpratapsingh/Downloads/DataSets_ClimateGPT
pip install -r testing/requirements_testing.txt
```

### 2. Example Usage

```python
# Use AI to predict failures
from testing.ai_test_intelligence import AITestIntelligence
ai = AITestIntelligence()
predictions = ai.predict_failures(code_changes, tests)

# Run intelligent selection
from testing.intelligent_test_selection import IntelligentSelector
selector = IntelligentSelector()
selected = selector.select_for_commit(changed_files)

# Self-heal flaky tests
from testing.self_healing_tests import SelfHealingTestRunner
runner = SelfHealingTestRunner()
success, attempts, error = runner.run_test_with_healing(test_id, test_func)

# Chaos test for resilience
from testing.chaos_engineering import ChaosTestRunner
chaos = ChaosTestRunner()
scenario = chaos.create_scenario("Timeout Storm", FaultType.TIMEOUT)
result = chaos.run_scenario(scenario, test_func)

# Track economics
from testing.testing_economics import TestingEconomics
econ = TestingEconomics()
roi = econ.calculate_roi(automation_cost_usd=50000)

# Get observability
from testing.advanced_observability import DistributedTracer
tracer = DistributedTracer()
trace = tracer.start_trace("test_execution")

# Enhanced DX
from testing.developer_experience import DeveloperExperiencePlatform
dx = DeveloperExperiencePlatform()
dx.notifications.notify_test_results(success=True, test_count=50, failure_count=0)
```
